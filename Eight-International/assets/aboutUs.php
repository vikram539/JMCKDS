                                <p>The passage of the Mauritius Offshore Business Activities Authority (MOBAA) Act in 1992 signalled the beginning of Mauritius's role as a financial services provider. This law established a regulatory authority for offshore matters, the Mauritius Offshore Business Activities Authority (MOBAA), which, along with a number of exemptions from certain provisions of the local Companies Act, created an environment conducive to the channelling of foreign investments into emerging markets. Mauritius currently provides a number of fund structures aimed at meeting the unique objective needs of fund promoters.</p>
