                <p  class='mb-4'>A financial plan is a detailed summary of your financial goals and we will help you take the measures necessary to accomplish them. This will be determined by criteria such as the cost of current and fixed assets, promotional costs, and long-term planning. Capital requirements must be considered from both short- and long-term perspectives.</p>
                <p class='mt-4'>The capital structure refers to the capital composition, that is, the relative kind and percentage of capital required in the firm. This involves short- and long-term debt-equity ratio considerations while developing financial policies for cash management, lending, borrowing, and so on. Our finance managers guarantee that scarce financial resources are used optimally and at the lowest feasible cost to maximise returns on investment.</p>
